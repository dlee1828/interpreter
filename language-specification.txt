A variable name is a word that starts with a letter. 
All variables have integer types.

A variable can only be assigned to one of the following:
1. A literal value
2. A variable 
3. A binary operation 
4. A function call 

Here are examples:
`x = 7`
`x = y`
x = x + 1
x = a * b
x = my_func(a, b, c)

If the specified variable doesn't already exist in the current scope, it will be initialized when assigned.

Valid binary operators are: +, -, *, /, %, >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, &&, ||

If statements are written as such:
if ([condition]) {

}
else {

}
[condition] must be a binary operation.

While loops are similar:
while ([condition]) {

}

Functions are defined as such:
function (a, b) {
    a = a + 1
    return a * b
}
A function can have any number of parameters.
A function does not have to have a return statement, but if it does, 
the return value must be a literal, variable, binary operation, or function call.
Functions are not able to access any variables outside their scope.
Functions cannot be recursive.

Finally, you can use print() to print things.
The argument to print must be a literal, variable, binary operation, or function call.
